A simple App for Stackato which prints the chosen name, the instance number and the port of the deployed App in a simple yet clear view.

This demo is appropriate for the following scenarios:
+ Show that multiple instances of an App are running by displaying the different ports and instance numbers.
+ Show that an application is still accessible while deploying a new version.
+ Show how changes affect the application, e.g. by changing the displayed HPE Helion Logo.
+ Show how additional instances are launched when having a high CPU Load.

Known Issues
========
When having multiple instances running the produce Load button does not work properly. Issue is related to sockts.io
