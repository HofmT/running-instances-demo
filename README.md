A simple App for Stackato which prints the chosen name, the instance number and the port of the deployed App in a simple yet clear view.

This demo is appropriate for the following scenarios:
+ Show that multiple instances of an App are running by displaying the different ports and instance numbers.
+ Show that an application is still accessible while deploying a new version.
+ Show how changes affect the application, e.g. by changing the displayed HPE Helion Logo.
